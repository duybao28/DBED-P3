Question:
Suppose that you are given source code for a DBMS that does not support indexing. This code was extensively tested, so we have a high degree of confidence that it works correctly. Now you were asked to extend the code, such that the indexing is supported. How would you test your extended code to make sure it works properly with indexing? Note that you don't need to provide any additional code for this question, just the answer.

I'd first run the same SELECT...WEHRE queries without any index and save the result. Then I'd create the index and re-run the exact queries to check whether the results are identical.
By doing this, I can check for cover empty table, single row, all same values, duplicates, or different columns.
Then I'd test errors such as index on missing column, data that was created twice, or drop non-existent data.
After that, I'd also re-run the old tests with no index to make sure nothing broke.
Finally, on a large dataset, I'd time the queries before or after indexing to show a clear speed-up while keeping the same results.
